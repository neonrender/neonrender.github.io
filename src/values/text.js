        <strong>neonrender</strong> started out as a concept of a "magical" render engine
    to render worlds beyond human imagination. And for the first step forward,
    I've decided to make a 4D renderer. Hopefully this will take things to the
    next step, whatever that may be.

    Other than that, I plan on using this website as a journal for other things
    I'm working on as well as whatever that comes to my mind.

    <br/>
    I'll try to keep it interesting for those who stumble onto this place.
